## <a name="about-me">About me!</a>

As a Chemical and Energy Engineering Masters graduate, I've gained experience in researching energy innovations with an interest in new tech along with modelling and numerical problem solving skills. After recovering from kidney failure and a transplant I worked as a self-employed trader, where I trained myself to be self-motivated and eager to learn new skills.

My interest in technology and software development started during my university degree when I ventured into web design as a hobby. As a trader, I realized the need to improve speed and reduce mundane tasks, such as manually tracking data and data entry. This led me to acquire skills in JS and API use to automate tasks and improve efficiency.

Now, I am passionate about problem-solving and eager to transition into a software engineering career. I have recently graduated from Makers Academy, a highly respected bootcamp, to enhance my coding skills and build innovative solutions to complex problems. With a solid foundation in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and React through self taught courses prior to the bootcamp, I am excited to apply my technical abilities and creativity to contribute to the software engineering industry.

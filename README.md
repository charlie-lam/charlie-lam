As a Masters graduate in Chemical and Energy Engineering with a keen interest in problem-solving, I am excited to pursue a career in software engineering. My journey into software engineering began after undergoing a kidney transplant, which inspired me to explore new fields and broaden my skill set. To further develop my coding skills, I recently completed the Makers Academy bootcamp. I have a strong foundation in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and React, which I gained through various courses prior to the bootcamp. I am eager to leverage my technical expertise to develop innovative solutions to intricate challenges.
